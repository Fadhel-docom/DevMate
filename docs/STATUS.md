# DevMate Status

## Current milestone
Phase 1 — foundation and local demo.

## Completed
- [x] Created public GitHub repository with MIT license and README.
- [x] Created `feature/phase-1-foundation` from `main`.
- [x] Defined zero-cost, no-OmniRoute, no-RateNest-modification constraints.
- [x] Added responsive React/Vite/TypeScript workspace branded DevMate.
- [x] Added project creation/switching, task creation/completion, and localStorage persistence.
- [x] Added clearly labelled local mock chat; no model provider calls.
- [x] Added Vitest persistence tests.
- [x] Added GitHub Actions CI.
- [x] Added a non-blocking dependency-audit report step to expose exact advisory names and affected packages; its first run is pending.
- [x] Removed the CI cache dependency on a missing lockfile.
- [x] Corrected FormEvent type usage and changed build to `tsc --noEmit && vite build`.
- [x] Expanded product requirements and architecture for portfolio management, AI coordination, quality governance, competitor research, SEO, and CAO/answer-engine visibility.
- [x] Created the shared operations room with the strategic mandate and handoff rules.

## Verified CI result
- Workflow: **DevMate CI**, run #12.
- Run ID: `42041033569`.
- Run URL: https://github.com/Fadhel-docom/DevMate/actions/runs/42041033569
- Job: `verify` — success.
- Node: v20.20.2; npm: 10.8.2.
- `npm install`: passed.
- `npm test`: passed — 1 test file, 3 tests.
- `npm run build`: passed — TypeScript check and Vite production build.
- Code commits verified by this run: `d8423b7a9ca9db33cb002d18a784799a462b2f4f` and `f99369740a3c37cab957e46265398070ff06d465`.
- This verifies CI for the code changes above; it does not verify Android browser behavior or production deployment.

## Security / dependency follow-up
- The same npm install log reported **6 dependency vulnerabilities**: 3 moderate, 1 high, and 2 critical.
- Advisory details and affected dependency paths have not yet been retrieved.
- Do not run `npm audit fix --force` blindly. Identify exact advisories and compatible fixes first.
- A committed lockfile is still a reproducibility improvement to do after generating it in a real npm environment; current CI uses `npm install`.

## Not yet verified
- [ ] Identify and resolve or explicitly accept the dependency audit findings.
- [ ] Commit a valid npm lockfile and move CI to `npm ci` when generated and reviewed.
- [ ] Verify project/task persistence after reload in an actual browser.
- [ ] Verify the responsive UI on Android.
- [ ] Accessibility and broader UI tests.
- [ ] Deploy to a free static host only after release checks.

## Current branch and PR
- Branch: `feature/phase-1-foundation`
- PR #1: https://github.com/Fadhel-docom/DevMate/pull/1
- PR remains draft / not merged.

## Next action
Inspect the new CI run after the dependency-audit reporting step. Identify direct/transitive vulnerable packages and safe compatible upgrades, and have Claude independently review the proposed changes. Then add focused UI/persistence tests and complete Android browser verification. Do not merge or deploy until the quality gate is satisfied.
